## divide(x,y)

This function will take in two numbers (x and y) and dive x by y and return the output to the user
Try: print(divide(6,2))
This will return 3

## divideWithRemainder(x,y)

This function will take in two numbers (x and y) and divide x by y and return the output to the user as well as any
remainder that may result from this division 

Try: print(divideWithRemainder(9,2))
This will return an array of the number rounded to the floor which is 4 in this case and the remainder since 9/2 is not a whole number 
so it will also return 1
This will return: 4,1
